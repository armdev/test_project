                                                them if we see them.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Public Comments</strong>: Private 
                                                messaging is often the best way to resolve a dispute with an unhappy 
                                                customer, but business owners can also address issues publicly by 
                                                posting a public comment. As with private messaging, we ask that 
                                                business owners upload a clear photo of themselves to help personalize

                                                violence, drug use, nudity, near nudity, or suggestive acts. Also, 
                                                please don't use your video to disparage other businesses, users or
